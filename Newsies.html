<p>If you want to be the greatest Pokémon trainer there ever was, you should know the strengths and weaknesses of not only your own Pokémon, but also of other Pokémon that you want to fight or tame. This cheatsheet from Pokémon Go Database lets you quickly reference how your own Pokémon measure up against others. </p>

<p>In every Pokémon game, attacks from one Pokémon type to another can have a large, normal, or no effect. It all depends on the match-up. For example, Squirtle is a water-type Pokémon, so attacks on a fire-type like Charmander are very effective. If you’ve played the older Pokémon games, you might find that some mechanics work a bit differently in Pokémon Go</p>
            

<div style="background-color:grey;padding:20px;">
<p>You can find out your Pokémon type by checking your Pokédex. Check the chart below to see the amount of damage that can be dealt or received, based on the Pokémon match-ups.</p>

<p>If it seems like some pokémon in Pokémon Go are a lot harder to catch than others, you’re not crazy. Every pokémon in the game has a predetermined base difficulty when you try to catch them.</p>

<p>There are other things at play when you try to catch a pokémon, however. The pokémon’s level, flee rate, and your throwing accuracy all affect your odds, not to mention items like Razz Berries and better PokéBalls. Legendary pokémon like Mew, Mewtwo, Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres all currently have a base capture rate of 0%, suggesting that acquiring them will be some sort of special event.</p>

<p>Your device will vibrate to alert you when a wild Pokémon is nearby. If you don’t see any Pokémon nearby, take a walk! Pokémon love places like parks, so try visiting a local recreational area. You can attract more Pokémon to your location by using an item known as Incense.
Some wild Pokémon appear only in certain environments and climates. For example, some Pokémon may appear only near lakes, oceans, or other bodies of water.
Pokémon located in your area are displayed in the Nearby Pokémon section in the bottom right of the screen in Map View. Pokémon already in your Pokédex will show in color, and Pokémon you haven’t previously encountered appear as silhouettes.</p>

<p>On January 25, 2017, there will be many many pokemon in a new world to find and catch</p>

        <p>It remains to be seen if running back Jamaal Williams will break Harvey Unga's all-time career rushing record at BYU, but it is clear as the 2016 college football season approaches that the senior from Fontana, Calif., will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I hope I've made my mark here, in a good way," Williams said.</p>

<p>Having missed the 2015 season for personal reasons, Williams is back in 2016, and still arguably one of the most popular players to ever pass through Provo, even if his absence last year left the team a bit thin at running back, and without its biggest playmaker on offense. One minute he is teasing a reporter about getting shorter instead of taller; the next, he is sharing his nicknames for various members of the coaching staff.</p>
